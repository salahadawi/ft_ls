</p>

The goal of this project was to recode a often used system function, "ls".
Optional arguments, such as -l, -R, -a, -r and -t have been recoded, among other features.

## Usage

The compiled binary works just like ls. Optional arguments can be stacked, and one or more folders/files to search can be specified.
