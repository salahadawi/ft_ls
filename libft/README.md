# libft - Coding our first basic C library
The aim of this project was to code a basic C library that we could use in our future projects.

My other projects, [get_next_line](https://github.com/salahadawi/get_next_line) and [ft_printf](https://github.com/salahadawi/ft_printf) have been added to this library.

## How to use:
1. Clone the repository.

	``` git clone https://github.com/Hahli144/libft.git ```

2. Compile the library

	``` make all ```
  
The result is a library called libft.a, which can then be linked to a project.
